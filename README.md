## 🚀 Project Overview

This project uses **MediaPipe Hands** for accurate detection and tracking of hand keypoints (landmarks) and leverages **OpenCV** for real-time video processing and display.

Run the code to detect hands live on your webcam feed and visualize the keypoints with connected lines.

## 🛠️ Features

- 🖐️ Detect up to 2 hands simultaneously  
- 🎯 Track 21 key landmarks per hand  
- ⚡️ Fast real-time processing  
- 🖼️ Two windows: camera feed and hand landmarks overlay (black canvas)

## 📋 Requirements

- Python 3.7+  
- OpenCV (`opencv-python`)  
- MediaPipe (`mediapipe`)  
- NumPy (`numpy`)
